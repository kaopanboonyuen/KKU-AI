## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction: Why Transformers?

Transformers were introduced by Vaswani et al. in the landmark paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (2017).
They solved the limitations of traditional RNNs by relying entirely on **self-attention mechanisms** ‚Äî allowing models to focus on different parts of input data simultaneously and efficiently.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Transformer Architecture Basics

### Key Components:

* **Input Embeddings:** Converts tokens (words, pixels) into vectors.
* **Positional Encoding:** Adds sequence order info.
* **Multi-Head Self-Attention:** Core innovation allowing the model to weigh input parts differently.
* **Feed Forward Networks:** Non-linear transformations after attention.
* **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections:** Help training deep networks.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Transformers in Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Popular Models:

* **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** Pretrained using masked language modeling; great for understanding context.
* **GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer):** Autoregressive model for text generation.
* **T5, RoBERTa, XLNet, etc.:** Variations improving pretraining or architecture.

### Why They Matter:

Transformers dominate NLP because they capture **long-range dependencies** and context better than RNNs or LSTMs.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Vision Transformers (ViT)

Traditionally, CNNs ruled computer vision ‚Äî but ViT applies transformer architecture directly to image patches.

### Highlights:

* Image is split into patches, flattened, and embedded.
* Positional encoding helps preserve spatial info.
* Achieves competitive or better results than CNNs on many benchmarks.

### Paper to Read:
